        <p>The Coffee Movement is more than just a cafe; it's a community hub and a coffee laboratory all rolled into
            one. Founded in 2016 by Bryan Overstreet and Reef Bessette, the journey began in the back of a 1969 VW bus,
            bringing a unique coffee experience to wherever their wheels took them. After a couple of years as a mobile
            cafe, they found a quaint space in an unassuming street in Chinatown, with a view of the cable cars passing
            by. This small cafe has now become a beloved gathering spot for the community and a hidden gem for coffee
            aficionados seeking some of the finest coffee from roasters around the globe..Since then, The Coffee
            Movement has expanded, opening a second shop and assembling a team dedicated to mastering the art of coffee
            and advocating for a culture of caring. We invite you to drop by and explore our ever-changing selection of
            coffee roasters. Until then, take care of yourself and support your local cafe.</p>
